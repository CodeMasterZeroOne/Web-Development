    <h3>Cobh known from 1849 until 1920 as Queenstown</h3>
    <div id="columncountthree">
            <img id="smallimages" src="img/about1.jpg"><p>Cobh is a town in Ireland, on an island in Cork city’s harbour. It’s known as the Titanic’s last port of
            call in 1912. Titanic Experience Cobh is a themed attraction in the former White Star Line ticket office.
            More displays on the liner are in the Cobh Heritage Centre, which also explores how Cobh became an
            embarkation point during Ireland’s mass emigrations. North of town, huge Fota Wildlife Park is on Fota
            Island.</p>
        <p>Cobh (pronounced 'cove') is a charming waterfront town on a glittering estuary, dotted with brightly
            coloured houses and overlooked by a splendid cathedral. It's popular with Corkonians looking for a spot of
            R&R, and with cruise liners – each year around 75 visit the port, the second-largest natural harbour in the
            world (after Sydney Harbour in Australia).</p>
        <p>It's a far cry from the harrowing Famine years when more than 70,000 people left Ireland through the port
            in order to escape the ravages of starvation (from 1848 to 1950, no fewer than 2.5 million emigrants passed
            through). Cobh was also the final port of call for the Titanic; a poignant museum commemorates the fatal
            voyage's point of departure. Cobh is on the south side of Great Island. Visible from the waterfront are
            Haulbowline Island, once a naval
            base, and the greener Spike Island, formerly a prison and now a tourist attraction.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <div id="columncountthree">
        <img id="smallimages" src="img/about2.jpg"><p>For many years Cobh was the port of Cork and has always had a strong connection with Atlantic crossings. In 1838 the Sirius, the first steamship to cross the Atlantic, sailed from Cobh. The Titanic made its last stop here before its fateful journey in 1912, and when the Lusitania was torpedoed off the coast of Kinsale in 1915, it was here that many of the survivors were brought and the dead buried. Cobh was also the last glimpse of Ireland for the people who emigrated during the ­Famine.</p><p>In 1849 Cobh was renamed Queenstown after Queen Victoria paid a visit. The name lasted until Irish independence in 1921 when, unsurprisingly, the local council reverted to the Irish Cobh.</p><p>The world’s first yacht club, the Royal Cork Yacht Club, was founded here in 1720, but now operates from Crosshaven on the other side of Cork Harbour.</p>
