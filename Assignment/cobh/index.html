    <h3>Welcome to Cobh</h3>
    <h4 style="width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">Cobh was the departure point for 2.5 million of the
        six million Irish people who emigrated to North America between 1848 and 1950. These included Annie Moore and
        her two brothers – the first immigrants to be processed on Ellis Island in New York. On 11 April 1912
        Queenstown was the final port of call for the RMS Titanic as she set out across the Atlantic on her ill-fated
        maiden voyage. The RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-Boat off the Old Head of Kinsale on May 7, 1915. The
        survivors were brought to the town of Cobh, and over one hundred victims lie buried in the Old Church Cemetery
        about a mile north of the town. Famous boxer, entertainer, wrestler and playboy Jack Doyle is also buried in
        this cemetery. Cobh is a pretty town built on a steep hill on Great Island in Cork Harbour. It is just 20
        minutes from Cork city and there are hourly rail connections to and from the city. The town’s architecture and
        streetscape is distinctly Victorian. St. Colman’s Cathedral dominates the town. It’s 49-bell Carillon is the
        only such instrument in Ireland and is the largest in Ireland and Britain.</h4>
